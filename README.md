## Future

Deploy to a CDN so it can be installed as a PWA

`npx snowpack build` should build a deployable in the `build` folder but I don't know where to deploy it. I used to use rawgit.

githubpages - might as well create a ci as well (settings, page generator from ./README.md)
See https://pages.github.com.

## Testing

There are no tests...just walk around

## Running

`npm install` - install openlayers, typescript, snowpack

`npm run test` launches app
